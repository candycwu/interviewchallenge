Project Outline:
Build a website contact form. Access to the form should be protected via a login screen. The form should contain fields for Name, Email and message at a minimum. Upon submit, the form should send the message to the email provided in the form, with the name as the email subject. Store the message in a database. Stored messages should be viewable via a link on the form screen.
